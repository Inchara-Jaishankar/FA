Full-stack Social Media application (basically FB clone) with PHP, JS, MySQL

Users can sign up, create posts and upload images, like posts, comment on posts, chat with other users, see notifications and user profiles and add users as friends, change user settings, search for users with AJAX and much more.

* Basically possible to do everything, that users can do on a simple social media platform.

The most complete PHP application I have yet created from scratch.
